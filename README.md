Shopping Cart Exercise 

** README.md file assisted, guided, and copied by Professor Rossetti's example in the class Shopping Cart Exercise **

# Instructions
In the Shopping Cart Exercise, we will develop a Python application that will help grocery store employees do their job while fulfilling the requests of the store owner. 

Before starting the actual exercise, we need to download, setup and run the application. 

First, we need to go to GitHub and follow the "Setup" instructions below. After completing that step, we need to have make a local copy on your own computer to develop. 

Throughout the entire development, remember to use the command-line or GitHub Desktop software to intermittently "commit", or save new versions of, your code. And remember to push / sync / upload your work back up to your remote project repository on GitHub at least once before you're done.

If you are able to implement the basic requirements with relative ease, or if you are interested in a challenge, consider addressing one or more of the "Further Exploration Challenges". Otherwise, if you need help breaking the problem up into more manageable pieces, consult the "Guided Checkpoints". And if you would like a narrated walkthrough, consult the "Guided Screencast".

# Setup

# Repo Setup 

Use the GitHub online interface to create a new remote project repository called something like "shopping-cart". When prompted by the GitHub online interface, let's get in the habit of adding a "README.md" file and a Python-flavored ".gitignore" file (and also optionally a "LICENSE") during the repo creation process. After this process is complete, you should be able to view the repo on GitHub at an address like https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/shopping-cart.

After creating the remote repo, use GitHub Desktop software or the command-line to download or "clone" it onto your computer. Choose a familiar download location like the Desktop.

After cloning the repo, navigate there from the command-line:
cd ~/Desktop/shopping-cart

Use your text editor or the command-line to create a file in that repo called "shopping_cart.py", and then place the following contents inside:

    ## shopping_cart.py

Make sure to save Python files like this whenever you're done editing them. After setting up a virtual environment, we will be ready to run this file.

# Enviornment Setup 

It is possible to complete this project using the "base" Anaconda environment, because the basic requirements don't require any third-party packages. However if you eventually end up tackling bonus challenges that require third-party packages, then you'll want to create and activate a new Anaconda virtual environment, and use a "requirements.txt" file approach to installing your packages:

    ## IF USING THIRD-PARTY PACKAGES, USE A NEW ENV:
conda create -n shopping-env python=3.8 
conda activate shopping-env
pip install -r requirements.txt # (after specifying desired packages inside)
Within an active virtual environment of choice ("base" or project-specific), demonstrate your ability to run the Python script from the command-line:

python shopping_cart.py

If you see the provided "products" data structure, you're ready to move on to project development. This would be a great time to make any desired modifications to your project's "README.md" file, such as adding instructions to tell someone else how to download, setup and run your app. When you're done, make your first commit, with a message like "Setup the repo".
